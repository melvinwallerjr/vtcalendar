The project has not had any activity in seven months and I was wondering if anyone has heard from the project owners. I've tried contacting the project owners to contribute to the project but not gotten a response.

I've done some work on the release candidate and was hoping to share my efforts. I've cleaned up a lot of existing issues and added or adjusted code for some of the requested features. Below is a list of some of the items I've addressed. As this is not an official release candidate I have appended a revision letter to the version number.

2.3.0.550 RC 1a (updated November 2009)
--------------------------------
 - corrected session management that required you to log into every page view to administer the calendar
 - updated session management to maintain proper sponsor editing status when switching calendars while logged in
 - corrected login process to prevent repost and making admin pages not viewable when logged out
 - corrected an error in 'upgradedb.php' inserting the default record to 'vtc_calendar' with 'htmlheader'=null
 - corrected undefined $DebugInfo variable in 'upgradedb.php' to now use $GLOBALS['DebugInfo']
 - added a Debug Mode toggle that is available to Main Administrators to help locate problems in the calendar
 - corrected output of yearmonthday2timestamp()
 - updated emailaddressok() and checkemail() with a better structure test, and removed deprecated PHP function
 - replaced all uses of ereg() and eregi(), these functions are deprecated in PHP as of 5.3 and removed from 6.0
 - corrected error in file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() where '&' should have been '&&'
 - corrected missing event attribute name for $event['title'] in import.php
 - removed invalid use of BLOCKQUOTE, BLOCKQUOTE and Q tags are only to be use for literal quoting or paraphrasing of an external source, these tags are not for presentational adjustments
 - removed invalid and deprecated HTML tags for XHTML implementation (i.e. FONT, bgcolor=, and others)
 - corrected all link query strings via HTML encoding: http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#amp
 - corrected all language files to use HTML encoded content for XML/XHTML and cross-language encoding support
 - added a language modify/create page to allow Main Administrators to adjust current or add new language support
 - modified code to properly represent TABLE headers where appropriate
 - upgraded all HTML content to be XML/XHTML compliant
 - modified markup for context, such as using <p>..</p> in place of ..<br><br> where appropriate
 - moved additional in-page content strings to language file calls where they belonged
 - corrected invalid month/day name trimming to 3 characters where short name should have been used
 - replaced the color picker with a more reliable version that offers more functionality
 - corrected error in logic preventing feedback messages for event time errors
 - added a WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE) to the event submission page to allow HTML encoded event pages, language packs are available from http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php
 - added a field for web map links for directions to the event
 - changed event contact e-mail field to also allow contact web addresses to reduce spammer problems
 - updated form entry fields to accept HTML character encoding (more work on this could be done for a user friendly experience)
 - expanded automatic character encoding of event submission fields to help avoid XML/XHTML compliance issues
 - fixed 'timed event' submission to accept ending times up to and including midnight
 - adjusted the PRINT CSS to improve the printable output
 - changed the 'Powered By' footer to a function call and added it to the footer template for more consistent page rendering and to make it easy to omit from the calendar if necessary
 - replaced calendar header icon with the one currently used by the VTCalendar project site, resized
 - placed the administrator/sponsor login status in an unused area of the calendar header for a more consistent user experience
 - added a calendar jump-to to the side navigation to make it easy for the user to change to other calendars
 - added the source calendar name to the listing of any event in the main calendar that originates from a sub-calendar
 - removed the use of HTML comments to 'hide' code from the browser
  * NEVER EVER-EVER-EVER comment out code/content with an HTML comment!
  * The content is still processed by PHP adding to server load and delaying page delivery.
  * === AND ===
  * The content is still sent to the client using more bandwidth.
  * === AND ===
  * Some browsers (like older Netscape) errors on parsing HTML comments by matching
  * opening comment tags (<!--) with "ANY" closing angle bracket (>) and showing the hidden code


NOTE:
I've taken care in updating and editing the project to improve support of code standards. However, as I don't use all of the features and functionality that the project incorporates, I have not had the opportunity to test for all possible minor bugs that I may have introduced. If you find any problems or issues I will gladly correct them.
