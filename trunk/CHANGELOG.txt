2.3.0 (released September 10, 2008)
--------------------------------
- Changed to use CSS to style the pages
- Forced 'calendarid' in links to make sure calendar the right calendar is displayed when multiple calendars are being used by one person.
- Added more LDAP options on config.inc.php.
- "ROBOT" meta-tag added to header to so that spiders only index the event pages, and not the day/week/month views.
- The page title (<title>) now includes specific information about the page. For example, when looking a day's events, it will read "Day: Wednesday, September 10, 2008" rather than just "Day". Events will include the event title.
- Column with mini-calendar can now be toggled to appear on the right if desired.
- Mini-calendar now uses AJAX-like calls to avoid refreshing the entire page when clicking the small << >> buttons next to the month name.
- Duration of the event now appears with the start time in day/week view.
- Events now fade to gray when their end-time has passed, or if the next day is reached in the case of "all day" events.
- Added message to approval page that the event will also be submitted to default calendar (if applicable).
- Major redesign to the page that displays when clicking the "Update" tab to make it more user-friendly.
- Major redesign to the create/edit event page to make it more user-friendly.
- When a new calendar is created, only one category is created named "General".
- New weekday repeating event choices (e.g. every sunday).
