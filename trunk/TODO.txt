NEW TODO:
===========================

High:
- Move all lang files to languages/en.inc.php
- Update install/upgradedb.php for PostgreSQL.
- Add a customizable prefix for table names to support multiple sets of vtcalendar tables within one Postgres database:
  (?<!')vtcal_(adminuser|admin|calendar|calendarviewauth|category|colors|event|searchedkeywords|searchfeatured|searchkeyword|searchlog|sponsor|template|user)
- Validate iCalendar export format.

Low:
- Assign DB results by reference. Example: $var =& DBQuery(...) or $results =& $db->query(...)
- Get row by reference. Example $row =& $results->fetchRow()
- Free results by using $results->free()
- Properly handle string returns from functions like DBQuery.
- Expand AUTH_HTTP_CACHE to LDAP
- Improve the way AUTH_HTTP checks if the authentication was successful or not successful by also checking the body text.
- Allow events to be flagged private so that you can only see them if you log in.
- "Send event to a friend" form.
- Allow data currently stored in session to be loaded from the DB or a file.

Finished:
X Add helpsignup.php link back to displaylogin() in functions.inc.php
X Should probably remove checking for HTTPS and just use SECUREBASEURL for the action of any forms that need to be secured. Search scripts for: _SERVER['HTTPS']
X Filters need to work on upcoming events view.
X A message should output when a keyword is being used in day/week/month view. There is currently no way for a user to know its filtering.
X $iday['css'] and $iday['color'] should be removed if not being used.
X Check current database schema vs 2.2.2.
X Determine what 'detailscaller' did and if they can be removed.
X Why was the saveall button disabled? ((Logic was unstable. Was removed in 2.2.2))
X Add colors to vtcal_colors for new CSS
X Allow SMTP e-mail via Pear::Mail.
X Check input validation constants in constants.inc.php to determine the correct values and merge the constants as necessary.

OLD TODO:
===========================

FEATURES
--------
X don't allow calendar admins to lock themselves out from the calendar by restricting access
- search by sponsor
- display email addresses as javascript to protect against spammers
- harden against cross-site scripting attacks
X make "manage users" available in default calendar for all newly created calendars (from Andre: Not sure what this means, but main admins can always access calendars now)
  (important for setting passwords when LDAP is not used)
- document export parameters timebegin=today and rangedays=30
- document difference between a calendar and categories

BUGS
----
- when admin edits an "to-be-approved" item it is automatically approved (which is OK) but
also becomes the event of the admin (which is not OK)
- using the filter resets the calendar to the view that includes today
- userids are sometime case sensitive, sometimes not -> you may be able to login with an upper/lowercase Id but not "Manage users" for example


IDEAS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------
- iCal import
- sorted log
- have a print view for the calendar
- have a calendar output designed for pocket PC
- implement a year view that highlights certain admin or user-defined categories
- make it an option whether or not the admin gets an email upon a new event submission (the admin should be able to change that)
- remember search parameter after using the back button
- have a feature to allow copy of all search results via vCalendar/iCalendar
- improve search further (take out special characters [intelligently]) e.g. "parents' day"
